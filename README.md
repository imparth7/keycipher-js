# KeyCipher

`keycipher` is a utility package for encrypting and decrypting text using AES-GCM with a secret key. It leverages the WebCrypto API to provide secure encryption and decryption functionalities.

## Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```bash
npm install keycipher
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a brief guide on how to use the `keycipher` package.

### Importing the Package

```js
const { encryptData, decryptData } = require('keycipher');
```

### Encrypting Data

To encrypt a piece of text, use the `encryptData` function. You need to provide the plaintext and a key string.

```js
const { encryptData } = require('keycipher');

(async () => {
    try {
        const keyString = 'your-secret-key'; // Replace with your key
        const plainText = 'This is a secret message'; // Replace with your text

        const encryptedData = await encryptData(plainText, keyString);

        console.log('Encrypted Data:', encryptedData);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Encryption Error:', error);
    }
})();
```

### Decrypting Data

To decrypt data, use the `decryptData` function. You need to provide the encrypted data and the same key string used for encryption.

```js
const { decryptData } = require('keycipher');

(async () => {
    try {
        const keyString = 'your-secret-key'; // Replace with your key
        const encryptedData = {
            iv: '...your IV...',
            cipherText: '...your cipherText...',
            tag: '...your tag...'
        }; // Replace with your generated encryption object

        const decryptedText = await decryptData(encryptedData, keyString);

        console.log('Decrypted Text:', decryptedText);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Decryption Error:', error);
    }
})();
```
